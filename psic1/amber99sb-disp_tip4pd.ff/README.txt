The force field parameters were developed and tested using Desmond.  If ported correctly, this GROMACS version should give results that are nearly equivalent to those using Desmond.  This version of the force-field has been subject to only some very basic sanity checks, and we have not observed inconsistencies, but it has not been extensively tested.  We cannot guarantee that it is free from bugs or typos.  Users are encouraged to run their own tests and report any inconsistency to trajectories@deshawresearch.com.
